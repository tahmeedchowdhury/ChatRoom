A Chat room website.

This work was created using the MERN Stack. REACT was used as the framework for this website to develop the front-end. Node.js and Express were used for the back-end of the project and MongoDB was used for the database. All information regarding the user and posts made to the chat room are stored in collections in a MongoDB database.



The intial page is a login screen where users can login or create a new account. They will then be taken to a second page which will contain the chat box as well as individual entry boxes for messages. There is a post button below the entry box which allows the user's post to be displayed on the chat board to the right. All messages will be displayed on the right corner from all users after they submit a message to be shown. The box on the bottom of the screen displays the messages the user has so far written. There is a log out button at the top left corner to exit this screen and return to the previous login screen. 




This project was written for personal use and to gain experience using MERN stack and is not deployed. All testing for the website has been done on the localhost:3000 server.
